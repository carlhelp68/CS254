Comments: Well done. However, note that while L1 and L2 can both be decided in polynomial time, they might not have the same runtime.
Further, in the Concatenation section, note that because the number of ways to split a string w into a prefix in suffix is proportional to the length of the input, your runtime analysis for that section is incorrect.
