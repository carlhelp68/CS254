Comments: You are on the right track here. However, note that there might not be a TM that decides partition (unless you prove that one exists). Further, note that Partition has elements of the form <S>, where S is a set of binary integers, and SubsetSum has elements of the form <S, t>; therefore, your function is outputting the wrong type of object.
Finally, you should show that your mapping function is computable in polynomial time.
