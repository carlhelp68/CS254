Comments: You have the right idea, but there are a few errors here. Primarily, you did not include enough information to fully define your constructed machines.

In the first part of your solution, note that when you push the input onto the left stack, you end up with the input string in reverse, so this 2-PDA is not an accurate simulation of a TM.
