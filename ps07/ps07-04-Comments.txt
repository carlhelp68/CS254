Comments: You are on the right track. However, you need to provide more justification that your constructions are correct and prove your claim; also, including a final conclusion about UNUSED_TM would have been clearer.
Furthermore, note that you assume that USED_TM has a recognizer in your proof that it is recognizable.
Finally, you do not explain what you think your results mean with respect to whether we can build a compiler that is guaranteed get rid of all code that would never be used when processing any input.
