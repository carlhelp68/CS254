PS10-03

Score: 3/4

Comments: Grading done by part.

Part A: Well done.

Part B: Your approach here is correct, but a bit more detail would have been better in this case.

Part C: Strictly speaking, you have shown through a mapping reduction that =/=SAT is NP-hard. To show that =/=SAT is NP-complete, you should also show that =/=SAT is in NP.
