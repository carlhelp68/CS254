Comments:
You're right that to show NP-complete, you need to show in NP and that IndSet â‰¤_p Book-shelf! Because you're missing the definition of book-shelf, it's a little hard to interpret the rest of your response. For in NP, why are we non-deterministically choosing books rather than tags, and what are edges between books? For the reduction, you need to give a function f that takes as input a <G,k> pair and outputs something of the form for book-shelf. You should never run a machine for an NP-hard language in a polynomial time reduction because we don't believe that can be done quickly enough.
