Thanks for sharing your experience learning from failure and figuring out how to use your resources! I find that the times I fail are often the times I learn the most, even though I get frustrated at the time. If you face struggles in the course, I hope you'll seek the help of me, the prefect, or your fellow classmates, and remember your own advice that Carleton is built around helping one another.
