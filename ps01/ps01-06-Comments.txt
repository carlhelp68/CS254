Comments: This was slightly difficult to read, so be sure to use formatting, bolding,
and other notation methods to more clearly separate your cases. Also, in general,
when using both addition and concatenation in the same proof, it is best to be
very clear about which operation is which to prevent confusion. You also did not
really prove you inductive case, so be sure to look at the solutions to get a better idea of what this
type of proof entails.
